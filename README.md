# BCI Final Project - EEG Signal Analysis

## ðŸ§  Introduction

This project is part of the Brain-Computer Interface course at [Your University].  
We aim to build a complete BCI system using EEG signals.  
The system performs preprocessing, artifact removal (ICA, ASR), feature extraction, and classification.  
We used publicly available EEG datasets collected during visual stimulus tasks.
