# BCI Final Project - EEG Signal Analysis

## Introduction

This project is a real-time cheer-up system based on Brain-Computer Interface .
We hope to add creative interactive elements into Taiwan sports culture and bring better experience for fans, also promote team spirit.
The system use EEG-Transformer to predict the mental state (Valence-Arousal-Dominance) of athleteâ€™s.
We also push the mental state to a cloud server that biuld by us to convert the mental state to lighting parameters. 
Then We develop a application to visualize the lighting parameters.
