## Introduction

Cheer Up System based on EEG is a real-time brain-computer interface (BCI) project designed to spark new energy in Taiwan’s sports culture. Our mission is to build a bridge between athletes and fans—emotionally and visually.

## Model Framework
Our system brings together signal processing and deep learning to turn raw brainwaves into real-time ambient experiences. Here’s what’s under the hood:

## System Pipline
By decoding EEG signals from athletes using a deep learning model, we estimate athlete's mental state in terms of Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD). These emotional signals are sent live to a custom-built cloud server, where they’re transformed into lighting parameters.
Here’s where the magic happens: we created a visual application that turns those parameters into dynamic light displays—fans literally see what the athlete feels. It’s a brand-new way to cheer, connect, and celebrate team spirit through synchronized emotion and immersive atmosphere.
